I've let this lapse, with levels up to 70, including things I like (new enemies) but not sure about progressions - might need 5th tiers, or slower progression (with lowering of money per hit).

Also, new maps, but some are experimental.

This branch is to bring into main only completed maps, and without levels beyond 60. But brings in some
of the games updates that happened on these branches.

branches:

lev_60_plus -> xhffi_levels (experimental levels - means "maps") -> updates_but_only_to_60_and_finished_maps (comment out levels beyond 60 and maps and some cleanup).

If spend more time on this, I might bring  armored trolls in before 60.

Complete the haunted level.

As levels go up - consider adjustments to Totem - top level gets more powerful as use with more powerful towers, so it gets kind of OP.

Level Isthus - now animating and adding sound - but should make so cant place in water?!?
 - need correct anitmation a bit - and on restarts.
